# Website

Replit Docs website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Serve

```
$ yarn serve
```


### Contributing

If you'd like to contribute please [fork this repl](https://docs.replit.com/__repl), then share your fork in an issue on the [github repo](https://github.com/replit/replit.github.io/). Alternatively, you can submit a pull request to the same github repo.

When adding new pages, the markdown file should be placed in the appropriate folder inside  (`programming-ide`/`teams-edu`/`misc`).

You can add React JSX components to markdown files as well since Docusaurus supports MDX which supports JSX.
