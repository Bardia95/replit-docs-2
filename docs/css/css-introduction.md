# CSS Introduction

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a simple language that we use to style a web page to make it presentable and attractive to users. It is a widely used language on the web. With CSS, you can control the look and feel of the multiple HTML web pages all at once. 

## CSS Benefits
- **Superior styles to HTML** - CSS offers a lot larger set of attributes than HTML, meaning you may give your HTML page a far nicer appearance with CSS rather than HTML attributes.
- **CSS saves time** - CSS may be written once and reused across several HTML pages.
- **Easy Maintenance** - To make a global change in multiple HTML pages, simply modify the CSS file, and all items on all pages will be instantly changed.
- **Search Engines** - Search engines will not struggle to "understand" its contents because of it's clean coding technique.
- **Offline Browsing** - CSS may use an offline cache to save web apps locally. We can visit offline websites using this.

## CSS Solved a Big Problem
HTML was invented to create to define the content of web page through HTML elements like:
>```
> <h1> First heading </h1>
> <p> Sample paragraph. </p>
> ```

When `style` attributes and styling tags were added to the HTML 3.2 specification, it became a nightmare for some web developers. The creation of massive websites, where typefaces and color information were added to every single page, became a time-consuming and costly procedure.

CSS was designed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to address this issue.

CSS eliminated the formatting of styles from the HTML code.

## CSS Example
CSS can be implemented through 3 different ways which we will discuss later on the next few chapters. To give you an overview on what CSS looks like, refer to this example syntax:
>```
>body {
>  background-color: khaki;
>}
>
>h1 {
>  color: lightcoral;
>  font-family: georgia;
>  border: 2px solid linen;
>}
>
>p {
>  font-weight: bold;
>  color: lightslategray;
>}
>```

In our next chapter, we will learn more about the syntax of CSS and how to implement it in our HTML webpage.
