# HTML Paragraphs

HTML paragraph or HTML `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Any content inside the `<p>` elements is treated as a paragraph. 

## Paragraph Properties
- The `<p>` tag automatically contains space before and after any paragraph.
- If multiple spaces and lines are added, the browser will reduce it to a single space and line. For example:
> ```
> <p>
>    This is a paragraph with multiple lines.
>    However, the browser will reduce it to a single line.
>    Look at the output below.
> </p>
>```

## `<br>` tag within Paragraph
If you want to add a line break in the middle of the paragraph, you can always use the `<br>` tag within the `<p>` elements. Look at the sample code below:
> ```
> <h1>Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night </h1>
> <p> Do not go gentle into that good night, <br> Old age should burn and rave at close of day; <br> Rage, rage against the dying of the light. </p>
>```

## `<hr>` tag within Paragraph
The `<hr>` tag is an empty tag that adds a horizontal line between elements. Look at the sample below:
> ```
> <h1> Still I Rise </h1> 
> <p> <hr> </hr> You may write me down in history <br> With your bitter, twisted lies,<br> <hr> You may tread me in the  very dirt <br> But still, like dust, I'll rise. </p>
>```

## `<pre>` in Paragraph element
As discussed, the `<p>` element will reduce multiple lines into a single line. We can use the `<pre>` element to define a preformatted text as an alternative. This element preserves both spaces and line breaks. It is also displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier).

Let's look at the sample code below:
> ```
> <pre>
> Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
> Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
> Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
> And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
> </pre>
> ```
