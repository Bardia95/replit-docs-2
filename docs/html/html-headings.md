# HTML Headings

An HTML heading or the `<h>` tag is the title or subtitle you want to be displayed on the webpage. When you use the heading tags `<h1>` to `<h6>`, the text is displayed in a bold format and the size of the text depends on what heading tag is used. `<h1>` is the largest heading and `<h6>` is the smallest heading.

>```
> <h1> First Heading </h1>
> <h2> Second Heading </h2>
> <h3> Third Heading </h3>
> <h4> Fourth Heading </h4>
> <h5> Fifth Heading </h5>
> <h6> Sixth Heading </h6>
> ```
Browsers automatically put line breaks before and after the heading.

## How Headings Help Search Engines
- Heading tells the users or readers what the webpage is all about.
- One of the many things that Google and other search engines find to determine the content of a webpage is the words inside the heading tags.
- Heading elements have SEO (Search Engine Optimization) value which helps a webpage be more user-friendly and visible to different search engines.
- It's important to remember that we shall only use heading elements to define the content of the heading only. It should not be used to make text big or bold.

## Customize Your Headings
Every HTML size has a default size. But, we can still further customize the style of our headings using the `style` attribute. For example:
> ```
> <h1 style="font-size: 60px;"> This is our customized heading. </h1>
> ```
